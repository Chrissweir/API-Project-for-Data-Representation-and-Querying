# Dublin Wheel Chair Access Guide

## Data Representation and Querying Project 2015

## Introduction
This project provides the design and documentation for the dataset "Dublin Wheel Chair Access Guide
" which is available at https://data.gov.ie/dataset/dublin-wheel-chair-access-guide

The data is only based on information from Dublin City Council. I would suggest to data.gov.ie to upload other datasets of all major cities and towns throughout Ireland and to particularly include other datasets of all countrywide public building wheelchair access points.

I would imagine that the type of people to use this app would be those who are either confined to a wheelchair or look after someone in a wheelchair.

### About the data

This dataset was received in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, and was downloaded from https://data.gov.ie/dataset/dublin-wheel-chair-access-guide.
The CSV file contains 814 rows, the first being a header row with the names of each field.
There are seven values on each line, which are as follows:

> * **id**: The id of the row // primary key?
> * **Venue**: The name of the venue // primary key?
> * **Address1**: The first part of the venue address
> * **Address2**: The second part of the venue address
> * **Address3**: The third part of the venue address
> * **Phone**: The phone number of the venue
> * **Web**: The website of the venue
