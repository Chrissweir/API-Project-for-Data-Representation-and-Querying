# Dublin Wheel Chair Access Guide

## Data Representation and Querying Project 2015

## Introduction
This project provides the design and documentation for the dataset "Dublin Wheel Chair Access Guide
" which is available at https://data.gov.ie/dataset/dublin-wheel-chair-access-guide

The data is only based on information from Dublin City Council. I would suggest to data.gov.ie to upload other datasets of all major cities and towns throughout Ireland and to particularly include other datasets of all countrywide public building wheelchair access points.

I would imagine that the type of people to use this app would be those who are either confined to a wheelchair or look after someone in a wheelchair.

### About the data

This dataset was received in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, and was downloaded from "https://data.gov.ie/dataset/dublin-wheel-chair-access-guide".
